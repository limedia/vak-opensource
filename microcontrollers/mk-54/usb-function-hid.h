    Parameters:

    Function:
        BOOL HIDTxHandleBusy(USB_HANDLE handle)

    Summary:
        Retreives the status of the buffer ownership

    Description:
        Retreives the status of the buffer ownership.  This function will
        indicate if the previous transfer is complete or not.

        This function will take the input handle (pointer to a BDT entry) and
        will check the UOWN bit.  If the UOWN bit is set then that indicates
        that the transfer is not complete and the USB module still owns the data
        memory.  If the UOWN bit is clear that means that the transfer is
        complete and that the CPU now owns the data memory.

        For more information about the BDT, please refer to the appropriate
        datasheet for the device in use.

        Typical Usage:
        <code>
        //make sure that the last transfer isn't busy by checking the handle
        if(!HIDTxHandleBusy(USBInHandle))
        {
            //Send the data contained in the ToSendDataBuffer[] array out on
            //  endpoint HID_EP
            USBInHandle = HIDTxPacket(HID_EP,(unsigned char*)&ToSendDataBuffer[0],sizeof(ToSendDataBuffer));
        }
        </code>

    PreCondition:
        None.

    Parameters:
        USB_HANDLE handle - the handle for the transfer in question.
        The handle is returned by the HIDTxPacket() and HIDRxPacket()
        functions.  Please insure that USB_HANDLE objects are initialized
        to NULL.

    Return Values:
        TRUE - the HID handle is still busy
        FALSE - the HID handle is not busy and is ready to send
                additional data.

   Remarks:
