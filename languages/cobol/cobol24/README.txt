Using the CD-ROM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the CD-ROM, click on the SETUP.EXE file in the SETUP
folder in Windows Explorer. The SETUP.EXE will create a program
group titled "Cobol in 24 Hours." Icons will also be created:
"What's on the CD-ROM" linking to this document, and "Install
Author's Source Code" linking to an install program that will
create a directory on your local drive and place all the
Author's examples in a newly created directory. Please use the
guide below to find the trial and demo software provided on
this CD-ROM.

If you want to view the directory structure on this CD-ROM
without having to run the SETUP.EXE (in Windows 95/NT), view

Troubleshooting Common Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The usual cause of the CD-ROM not running properly is a damaged
or dirty disc. Visually inspect the disc for possible flaws or
defects, and clean it properly. You should also test another
CD-ROM in your drive. This often reveals setup problems that
are not disc-specific. If these procedures fail, you can
contact us to get a replacement disc (contact information is at
the end of this file).

Depending on the topic and the generally accepted operating
system for the topic, the CD-ROM may use long and mixed-case
filenames requiring the use of a protected-mode CD-ROM driver.

The programs run slowly or don't run properly.
Do you have at least the follow amounts of RAM (memory)?

Windows 95:  8 megabytes
Windows NT:  8 megabytes

This may sound familiar, but Windows does not run well on
anything less than these amounts. If you only have the minimum
amount of RAM, the program may run slowly.

If you only have a single-spin CD-ROM drive, the time to access
the programs and source code may be lengthy.
